1) rewrite Arduino servo control code to smooth motion (log desired servo positions and "current" position, and move smoothly to them as updates come in.
2) Raspberry Pi with serial communication to arduino, running server
3) Plug current Unity control into Raspberry Pi
4) Make intermediary server that Rasberry Pi and Unity can connect to
